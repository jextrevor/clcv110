            <h1 class="display-4 mt-3">Should We Praise Modern Feminism?</h1>
            <p class="lead">In the wake of the #MeToo movement, feminism can sometimes go too far in its criticism of
                men.
            </p>
            <h6 class="mb-3">Trevor Jex - April 17, 2019</h6>
            <p>Feminism has history dating back to the early 1900s, when first wave feminists and progressives
                campaigned for women’s suffrage and political equality between the genders. Second wave feminism,
                arising in the 1960s and 70s, was aimed at achieving equality in the workplace and in material matters.
                third-wave feminism’s goal is cultural/social equality, and to end “toxic masculinity”.</p>

            <p>The Washington Examiner released an article entitled “The Women's March has twisted feminism into toxic
                femininity”, which has a negative outlook on third-wave feminism. In response to feminism's wish for
                safe legal abortion for all women, it says: “How thoroughly discriminatory. There is nothing so
                anti-freedom as stripping the most basic of human rights, life, upon which every other right is built.
                To do so and call it progress or justice is an abomination. And still, the Women's March proudly claims
                the life-ending procedure as a virtue to be praised.” While my own personal beliefs cause me to doubt
                the moral validity of the argument to have safe legal abortion available to all women, the Washington
                Examiner oversimplifies the issue. Abortion can mean many different things depending on how far the
                mother is in her pregnancy: Abortion at 10 weeks is very different from abortion at 24 weeks.</p>

            <p>Another goal of third-wave feminism is to end sexual abuse and objectification of women, a prevalent
                issue in today’s society. It is definitely wrong and it is a worthy goal to pursue to end it, or to at
                least control the effects of it. The #MeToo movement sought to end or at least expose the sexual abuse
                and mistreatment of women. But some radical/third-wave feminists went too far, blaming all men or
                calling all men oppressive. And some use the #MeToo movement to justify attacking and permanently
                destroying men’s reputations on the basis of social justice. As a result, some men feel afraid to talk
                to or to include female coworkers, which only exacerbates the problem of inequality in the workplace.
            </p>

            <p>One of the biggest issues with third-wave/radical feminism is that it has a tendency to target men
                instead of being willing to work together with men. It does not seek to cooperate but to fight and to
                tear men down. It is hard to argue that third-wave feminist phrases such as “the future is female”, “God
                is a woman”, or “No uterus, no opinion” are in favor of equality between men and women. These phrases
                rather seem to be putting men down and raising women up (especially feminists). When radical feminism
                gets to this hateful verbal abuse of men, it is no better than the “toxic masculinity” that it claims to
                condemn. If the goal of feminism is to achieve equality in some form between men and women, third-wave
                feminists should play by their own rules by not making sexist comments against men. The Washington
                Examiner gets it right when it says: “Legitimate sexual harassment and abuse won't be swept under the
                rug any longer. As society addresses issues that have been dismissed for far too long, it also must not
                give in to believing only one party is to blame. Femininity that rejects diversity, pins the onus on
                men, and gleefully embraces the destruction of life through abortion is just as destructive.”</p>

            <p>In the play Elektra written by Sophocles, Elektra and her mother Clytemnestra have an argument with each
                other. Clytemnestra justifies her killing of her husband due to the fact that he sacrificed her
                daughter. She ignores key parts of the situation, such as the fact that Agamemnon was required by the
                gods to sacrifice Iphigenia so that the army wouldn’t starve, instead ranting about how Agamemnon was
                “heartless” and “had no share in the pain of [Iphigenia’s] birth”. This sounds a lot like the feminist
                comments today that seek to degrade men and raise up women. Clytemnestra is targeting Agamemnon purely
                because he is male and is unable to have children, which is both sexist and irrational. Elektra sees
                this and is determined to avenge her father by killing her mother.</p>


            <p>When third-wave feminism purely seeks to blame and degrade men, we should, like Elektra, seek to
                eradicate it. We as a society can work together towards gender equality without tolerating sexism,
                whether it be against men or women.</p>
